### Stack:
- react
- react-router
- redux
- mui

### Installation
Install dependencies (make sure you have nodejs and npm or yarn installed)

    // with npm
    npm install
    
    // with yarn
    yarn install
    
Run it

    // with npm
    npm start

    // with yarn
    yarn start
    
### In my opinion
Redux is a powerful tool, but it doesn't have good compatibility with react, such as recoil. Also its not a good way for api request, for this case it is good to use react-query. MUI is a big component library which should be used for big project.
